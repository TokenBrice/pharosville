# PharosVille Motion Policy

Last updated: 2026-04-30

PharosVille uses one route-owned motion clock. Normal motion is driven by the
canvas `requestAnimationFrame` loop in `pharosville-world.tsx`; reduced motion
renders deterministic static frames and must not keep a RAF loop alive.

## Speed Classes

- Static: terrain, printed water labels, cemetery markers, dock footprints, and
  detail chrome.
- Slow: lighthouse beam shimmer, semantic water shimmer, fog, selected
  relationship pulse, harbor lamps, and lighthouse-attached birds.
- Medium: ship movement along sampled water routes and bounded harbor/civic
  activity effects.
- Fast: recent-change sparks and wake accents only, capped to selected, top, or
  recent-mover ships.

## Cue Priority

1. Selected or focused entity.
2. Active risk or critical PSI state.
3. Recent supply or data update.
4. Harbor, cemetery, or civic scenery state.
5. Ambient life attached to lighthouse, harbor, cemetery, or civic core.

## Caps And Parity

- Selected pulse: one selected entity family at a time.
- Relationship overlays: selected ship or selected dock only.
- Ship wake/effects: selected, top-supply, or recent-mover ships only.
- Ambient birds: capped to the lighthouse/far-sea set exposed in debug state.
- Harbor lights: fixed local civic-core list exposed in debug state.
- Harbor and civic effects: bounded local effect sets only.
- No independent CSS animation, sprite loop, minimap loop, interval, or timer may
  encode analytical state outside the main motion clock.
- Every analytical motion cue needs visual-cue registry metadata, DOM/detail or
  accessibility-ledger parity, and a reduced-motion equivalent.
- Ambient motion is allowed only as bounded maritime atmosphere attached to
  existing world areas. It must not introduce lore, decorative game objectives,
  or new data semantics.

## Ship Risk-Water Motion

- `calm`, `watch`, `alert`, `warning`, and `danger` map to the separated DEWS sea districts from Calm Anchorage through Danger Strait. Watch Breakwater now sits in the south basin and southeast reclaimed corner basin; `ledger` maps to Ledger Mooring spanning the entire top shelf and touching Calm Anchorage along the western flank.
- Higher DEWS turbulence should increase risk-water dwell, drift radius, and sailing wake intensity in this order: calm < watch < alert < warning < danger.
- Reduced-motion ships freeze at their risk-water idle tile, or Ledger Mooring for NAV ledger assets. Details and the accessibility ledger must expose named risk-water area, risk-water zone, home dock, chain presence, docking cadence, and evidence caveats.
- Routed normal-motion ships spend one third of each cycle moored at rendered docks. Non-titan ships are hidden while moored to rotate map-visible ship load; titan ships remain visible while docked.
- Dockless normal-motion patrols must not collapse to a near-static loop. If a named area is too small for meaningful travel, use current or adjacent same-purpose sea anchors while keeping samples on water tiles.

## Debug Contract

Development/test builds expose `window.__pharosVilleDebug` fields for browser
validation:

- `motionClockSource`
- `activeMotionLoopCount`
- `motionCueCounts`
- `motionFrameCount`
- `reducedMotion`

Reduced motion should report `activeMotionLoopCount = 0` and
`motionClockSource = "reduced-motion-static-frame"`. Normal motion should report
`activeMotionLoopCount = 1` and `motionClockSource = "requestAnimationFrame"`.
